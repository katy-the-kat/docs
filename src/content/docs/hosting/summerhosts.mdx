The term "Summerhost" is used for service providers that are poorly ran and/or operating illegally which should be avoided.

### Generally, you should avoid providers that feature these:

<ul class="pl-5 list-disc">
    <li>Unregistered business</li>
    <li>Website with false or missing information</li>
    <li>Improper billing (discord checkout etc)</li>
    <li>No Terms of Service or Privacy Policy</li>
    <li>Oversold servers</li>
    <li>Deceptive sales</li>
    <li>No SLA ("Service Level Agreement")
    <li>Obstructive Terms of Service that disallows doing basic stuff within the server (ex. pregenning)</li>
</ul>

### Here is a list of providers that feature these, which you should avoid:

| Host         | Why                                                 |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| [ThunderNodes](https://thundernodes.cloud) | Unregistered business, improper (discord) checkout |
| [NordHost](https://nordhost.cc) | Unregistered business, no Service Level Agreement (SLA) |

:::note If your service no longer meets the reason why it's listed, you can [submit a issue on GitHub](https://github.com/setupmd/docs/issues) to get said provider removed :::
