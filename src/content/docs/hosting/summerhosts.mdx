The term "Summerhost" is used for service providers that are poorly ran and/or operating illegally which should be avoided.

### Generally, you should avoid providers that feature the following:

<ul class="pl-5 list-disc">
    <li>Unregistered business</li>
    <li>Website with false or missing information</li>
    <li>Improper billing (discord checkout etc)</li>
    <li>No Terms of Service or Privacy Policy</li>
    <li>Oversold servers</li>
    <li>Deceptive sales</li>
    <li>No SLA ("Service Level Agreement")</li>
    <li>Obstructive Terms of Service that disallows doing basic stuff within the server (ex. pregenning)</li>
    <li>Lack of basic features such as databases and backups</li>
    <li>Pirating software used on the provider (ex. "nulled" WHMCS)</li>
    <li>Violating other project's rights (ex. commercially selling FiveM servers)</li>
</ul>

### Here is a list of providers that you should avoid with reasoning:
